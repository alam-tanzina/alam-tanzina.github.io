                 <p> During the week of Hackathon, students were asked to create a wireframe based on a social issue that they would like to put support towards. I collaborated with two classmates to create a job search app that ensured LGBTQ+ workers were able to find job opportunities with the guarantee that the job listings posted did not tolerate any form of harassment and discrimination</p>
